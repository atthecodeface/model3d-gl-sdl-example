//a Bone
/// Each bone has a transformation with respect to its parent that is
/// a translation (its origin relative to its parent origin), scale
/// (in each direction, although a common scale for each coordinates
/// is best), and an orientation of its contents provided by a
/// quaternion (as a rotation).
///
/// A point in this bone's space is then translate(rotate(scale(pt)))
/// in its parent's space. The bone's children start with this
/// transformation too.
///
/// From this the bone has a local bone-to-parent transform matrix
/// and it has a local parent-to-bone transform matrix
///
/// At rest (where a mesh is skinned) there are two rest matrix variants
/// Hence bone_relative = ptb * parent_relative
///
/// The skinned mesh has points that are parent relative, so
/// animated_parent_relative(t) = btp(t) * ptb * parent_relative(skinned)
///
/// For a chain of bones Root -> A -> B -> C:
///  bone_relative = C.ptb * B.ptb * A.ptb * mesh
///  root = A.btp * B.btp * C.btp * C_bone_relative
///  animated(t) = A.btp(t) * B.btp(t) * C.btp(t) * C.ptb * B.ptb * A.ptb * mesh
